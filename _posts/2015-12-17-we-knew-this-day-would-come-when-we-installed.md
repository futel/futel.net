We knew this day would come. When we installed this phone, the lock immediately jammed, and we couldn’t open or remove it. Over a year later, the phone finally malfunctioned. We couldn’t just pick or drill the lock, because it wasn’t the lock that was stuck, it was the arm and the latch. We eventually destroyed the mechanism without damaging the phone with a rotary grinder and a lot of patience (and hammering and prying).
