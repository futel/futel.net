[Open Signal: Portland Community Media Center "Hold the Phone" Art Installation Now on Display](https://www.opensignalpdx.org/news/hold-the-phone/)  

Works from artists Emily Fitzgerald, Molly Sherman, Machado Mijiga and Sailor Winkleman will be featured all year long in an installation titled Hold the Phone, a Futel phone installed outside of Open Signalâ€™s side entrance on NE Martin Luther King, Jr. Blvd and NE Graham street. Additionally, the phone offers free telephone calls, voicemail and telephone-mediated services.

This phone is funded in part by the Regional Arts & Culture Council.
