[ToorCamp Finale And More Fun With SDR, Hak5 1625](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PchBS-mngE&list=PLW5y1tjAOzI0w_GbtiEbYS5PGJ2pmxAIX#t=1430)  

Hak5 played with our phones at ToorCamp.

We kept a speakerphone connected to the conference line above the payphones, so when we wanted to hassle someone nearby, weâ€™d just call in to the conference line. Since the Shadytel toilet phone was usually dialed in to our conference line, it was also a live monitor of whatever was going on in there.
