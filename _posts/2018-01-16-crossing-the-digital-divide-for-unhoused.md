The Village Coalition, Futel, and Freewire are thrilled to announce the completion of the first stage of our goal of providing internet and communication services to unhoused Portlanders with the provision of a 10Mbps Enterprise Internet service to the rest stop ​Right 2 Dream Too​. The rest stop, located at 900 N. Thunderbird Ave, is operated by houseless and formerly houseless people and provides refuge, resources, and community to hundreds of houseless people per year.

Using hardware provided by Futel and networking services by Freewire, residents of and visitors to Right 2 Dream Too now have one more path to staying in touch with friends and family, accessing governmental and medical services, organizing volunteers and donations, and building networks of advocacy and resource sharing with other villages. The normal cost for this service is $300 per month plus an installation charge, all of which Freewire is donating. “Freewire is fortunate to have this unique opportunity to serve our community by delivering reliable dedicated internet access to our neighbors at Right 2 DreamToo. Our company appreciates the importance of Village Coalition and we take great pride in partnering with them on this project” says Christopher Scalera, Freewire’s General Manager.

The next goal for the project partners is to provide the same service to Portland’s other transitional housing communities.
