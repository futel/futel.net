<div class="caption">This phone kiosk was apparently hit by a car. A single bolt and cable stay kept it attached to the earth, but it seems like the enclosure and pedestal absorbed the impact, protecting the phone. It was gone a week later. Hopefully a collector picked it up and not a scrapper. Will Qwest replace it? Does Qwest bother to remove damaged street hardware?
