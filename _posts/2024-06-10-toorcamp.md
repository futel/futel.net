Futel will be at ToorCamp this June. Attendees may participate in the challenges and witness Karl Anderson present "Futel: How Creating North America's Fastest Growing Public Telephone Network Fulfills Our Objectives". Be sure to bring a telephone and a television set, otherwise you may have to participate in the Prole-TV telethon the hard way.
