We haven’t been posting much because there’s more important things going on in the USA and the world right now, and we want to make space for the people who need to be heard. But we’ve been getting a small amount of fashy attention lately, so we want to make sure we add our voice: Black Lives Matter!

We are working hard on Futel and other projects. More later!<br/>
