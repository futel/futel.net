Now available from all Futel phones is our newest feature: call a concentration camp! Select this option from the directory to be connected to a randomly selected concentration camp in the continental United States of America!

Because these concentration camps are fully operational, this is a valuable opportunity to learn about their functions, which include the detention, abuse, torture, and killing of human beings. As you may find yourself confined to one of these camps in the near future as their target populations are expanded, we recommend that you use this feature often.
