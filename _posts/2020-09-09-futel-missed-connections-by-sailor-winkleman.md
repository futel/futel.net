Futel Missed Connections by Sailor Winkleman, the next project for Hold the Phone, is live! This project was inspired by The Wishing Tree on 7th Ave, located only a few blocks from Open Signal, and Community Memory, the first public bulletin board system (BBS), which was originally installed inside of Leopoldâ€™s Records in Berkeley in 1973. Folks will be able to record, listen to, and reply to missed connections from any Futel public telephone (including the one located outside Open Signal on Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard) and can record messages online.
