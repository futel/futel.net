2016 has been an excellent year for Futel.

We installed three new phones, two of which are still standing on NE Ainsworth St and SE Taylor St, and continued service to our existing phones on SE Clinton St and at Right To Dream Too. By the end of the year, over 750 free outgoing calls were initiated per month.

Two new operators joined Futel. Over 50 complete operator calls were logged throughout the year.

An incoming line now extends the usefulness of several features of our street-facing phones. Our new interactive feature, the “Wildcard Line”, has collected contributions from Futel users, with which we have produced a number of amusing and instructive episodes. And as usual, there are random new experiences to experience, including a voice conference occasionally inhabited by helpful entities.

Futel operators have given talks, hosted outreach events, and produced installations at AFRU gallery and ToorCamp. Hours of ads have been dragged around town by surly bike couriers.

Our 2016 expenses were paid for with a grant by the Regional Arts and Culture Council, a grant from an anonymous individual, and many small donations. Equally important, many volunteer hours of effort and skill have kept us operating.

Our community influence and positive public impact have grown exponentially, and there can be no doubt that both will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.
