# Druid of Sisyphus Gardens Call Log 2020

The Druids didn’t exactly keep great records in 2020 (except for September), although it was a great year (Futel-wise). We received many memorable calls from memorable callers.



# Druid of Sisyphus Gardens Call Log

<ul>
<li>April: Caller wanted to know how to turn into a dog. A Transmutation spell like Polymorph Self should work.

</li>
<li>Sept 21: Caller asked if they could visit Sisyphus Gardens, I told them I’d get back to them on that. Caller then asked how long I’ve been a Druid and how old I was because they are interested in Druid stuff. I asked them if they had any other questions; “What’s your favorite color?”

</li>
<li>Sept 27: Two callers enjoying a nice mushroom time. Answered the first caller’s questions about Druids and Futel. The 2nd caller said they found out about Futel from the Dream Survey YouTube. They asked if I do this all day (sure, technically) and if our phone was red like they imagined (the cord is).

</li>
<li>Sept 27: Two different callers, the first caller was excited to finally talk to the Druid because they live close to the location of the first Futel. Second caller wasn’t sure what to ask me, so I said I can provide Druidic advice or Druidic secrets. Provided them with a Druidic secret.

</li>
<li>Sept 28: M called, they have been calling every time they find a new Futel phone!

</li>
<li>Oct 25: Caller told me their pitch to Netflix and asked me what I thought. I said I try to avoid being judgmental.

</li>
<li>Dec: Detroit called! Provided them with solid Druidic advice for the New Year.

</li>
</ul>
