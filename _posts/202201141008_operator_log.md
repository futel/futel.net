# Operator Log

Six operators logged over fifty operator calls in 2021. Some were goofy and some were dead serious. This sample of logged calls has some sensitive and many less interesting examples removed.



<ul>
<li><strong>2021-01-01</strong> Caller asked for room 44, or 44g, or IG44 unit. Offered to Google. Caller apologized, hung up.</li>
<li><strong>2021-01-16</strong> Caller asked if I made Futel, I replied that I was an operator who could provide information about how to use the phone. Caller asked what the phone was for, I told them they were free to experiment with it.</li>
<li><strong>2021-02-27</strong> Looked up the number for Oregon DMV</li>
<li><strong>2021-03-01</strong> Caller asked how to call the Willamette Valley Dream Survey, I told them to use the directory.</li>
<li><strong>2021-03-20</strong> Caller asked what I knew about the WVDS(ugh). I told him the truth, that we found a phone number on a flyer and added it to a directory. He said &ldquo;Interesting. Thanks.&rdquo;&hellip; is it?</li>
<li><strong>2021-04-02</strong> Caller was surprised to find a phone, was just curious about it. Told them they should check the directory and that they can make free calls all over North America. They said, for like an hour or something, I said why not. They told me to have a good weekend.</li>
<li><strong>2021-04-13</strong> Caller informed operator her name.</li>

<li><strong>2021-04-14</strong> Caller was surprised that the phone worked, didn&rsquo;t really need anything but was generally excited about the phone&rsquo;s existence and functionality.</li>
<li><strong>2021-04-16</strong> Caller asked if this was the State of Oregon Unemployment Division. I said &ldquo;No, this is the operator for Futel,&rdquo; and the caller said &ldquo;oh sorry man&rdquo; and hung up.</li>

<li><strong>2021-04-25</strong> Caller was just generally excited about and interested in Futel. They are making their rounds to all the Portland phones, only have 2 left I think.</li>
<li><strong>2021-04-28</strong> Caller asked the Operator for the phone number of an individual in another city.  Operator was not able to find this information readily on the internet but thanked the caller for using Futel.</li>
<li><strong>2021-05-01</strong> Heard some buzzing noise and then what seemed like a childs voice say &lsquo;Hey&rsquo; and then a hang up.</li>
<li><strong>2021-05-02</strong> Caller called to say “I love you.”</li>

<li><strong>2021-05-19</strong> Caller wanted to know what this phone was and Operator let him know it could make calls for free and asked if they could help with anything.  Caller said he was trying to reach the police station downtown.  Operator found a number for Portland Police downtown.  Caller said that was not the number he had.  Operator searched the number the caller gave and it was for the Multnomah County Justice Center downtown. Operator asked what happened when the Caller tried that number before, they said the screen of their phone was cracked, so they had trouble.  Operator advised hanging up and trying that number using the Futel phone.  Caller agreed and ended the call.</li>

<li><strong>2021-08-02</strong> Caller asked &ldquo;where are you at?&rdquo; I replied that it didn&rsquo;t matter and asked if I could help them. Caller replied &ldquo;yeah, where are you at?&rdquo;. I hung up.</li>
<li><strong>2021-08-02</strong> Caller asked my location, I replied that I wasn&rsquo;t interested in telling them. Caller asked me what questions they could ask me, I replied that I was an operator who could help them use the Futel phone.
