[Party Line #9](https://microcosmpublishing.com/catalog/zines/8419) is available from Microcosm Publishing.


> FUTEL's guerrilla public telephone project endures, bringing us a fresh year of imaginative anarchist telecoms with this latest entry in the Party Line zine series detailing their repairs, conundrums, triumphs, and philosophies over the course of 2023. Nine years of keeping public communication networks accessible and interestingâ€”plus, the title of this one rhymes.
>
> From the manifesto: "We are primarily driven by the basic needs that we see on the streets every day, by giving something away that is cheap for us but valuable to the recipient. But we hope that we can also build a tower of Babel on top of that, a monument of telephones and switching networks and cascading psychological structures which will give the community something else as well, something we may not appreciate until it has forever changed us." Viva FUTEL.
