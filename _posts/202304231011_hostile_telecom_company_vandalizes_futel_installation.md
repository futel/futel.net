# HOSTILE TELECOM COMPANY VANDALIZES FUTEL INSTALLATION

<h2>HIRED GOONS LEAVE LIBELOUS SCRAWL IN PATHETIC ATTEMPT TO DISRUPT SERVICE</h2>

Portland is home to several telecommunications companies besides Futel. While their shareholders envy our achievements, there have been no overtly antagonistic acts until April 2023, when uniformed representatives of a local telecom spray painted a threatening message on the sidewalk near our phone. The mercenary vandals then fled the scene in a company van.



This desperate attack on our infrastructure has failed. As propaganda, it is nonsensical. The signal is strong, which anyone can easily verify. As a threat, it is laughable. We have already demonstrated that our network cannot be stopped by the crowbars of thugs in the night.



Futel&rsquo;s users and operators are not dissuaded by this feeble attempt to compromise our service, and we remain resolute in the pursuit of our objectives.
