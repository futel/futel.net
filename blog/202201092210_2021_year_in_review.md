# 2021 Year In Review

We continued to hold fast through the attrition of a heartless world as well as the insults of enemy action. That&rsquo;s something.



<ul>
<li>One new phone deployed!</li>
<li>The 100th revision of the telephony server was deployed, which means that the software that makes the phones run was updated 100 times over the years. Some of these changes were noticible, and some were reliability upgrades.</li>
<li>Futel engineers provided implementation support for the Felicific Calculus exhibit by Eric Kunsman.</li>
<li>Wildcard Line episode 7 was released. Contribute to the Wildcard Line from any Futel phone.</li>
<li>RACC awarded a Make|Learn|Build grant to Futel, which is supporting the development of new installation technologies.</li>
</ul>

Most importantly, we continued to provide services to our phones and incoming line. Usage for the year included:



<ul>
<li>over 27,000 handset pickups</li>
<li>over 10,900 outgoing calls</li>
<li>over 7,400 calls received by the incoming line</li>
<li>698 calls to the Futel voice conference</li>
<li>117 attempts to communicate with the Druids of Sisyphus Gardens</li>
<li>105 calls to a randomly selected American concentration camp</li>
<li>96 calls to the Payphone Demultiplexer</li>
<li>87 calls to the mayor of Portland</li>
<li>54 calls to the Willamette Valley Dream Survey</li>
<li>51 calls to the mayor of Detroit</li>
<li>18 contributions to the Wildcard Line</li>
<li>10 calls to the mayor of Ypsilanti</li>
</ul>
