<div class="caption">We got some nice Ceeco vandal-resistant phones, supposedly from a school, but xnor and Tishbite were getting failing # and * keys in testing. They took them apart expecting to have to repair the keyboards, and found that the keys had been disabled with post-it notes. This is funny because we all carried tone dialers when we were in school.
