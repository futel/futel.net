<div class="caption">Death of the payphone. When the dead payphone and pedestal in front of the convenience store were missing, I asked the clerk if he knew who the provider was, because it is not common for them to remove decrepit phones anymore. He said that two guys had sawed the bolts and carted it off on a bicycle. &ldquo;The store was open but the clerk wasn&rsquo;t about to stop them&rdquo;.
