                    <p>We took a Futel installation to<a href="http://toorcamp.toorcon.net/"> ToorCamp</a> in Neah Bay, Washington.</p>

<p>Our closet. Survived the mist, but got warm in there.</p>

<p>Futel radiation monitor. Select option 2, hold the sample to the monitor, and hear a recording of how many millisieverts per hour it is emitting on the handset.</p>
<p>We had been planning on running a hostile conference call, where every phone in the camp would be called at once and connected to the conference - an ancient prank phone call trick. But Shadytel had a hardware failure with the machine that was providing us SIP service, and we only had equipment to bridge one PSTN line to our VOIP box at a time. So instead we called every phone, randomly, one phone every minute, and had a synthesized voice read the current ambient radiation.</p>

<p>Noisebridge put our conference line on their amplifier. When we heard it and realized that half the camp had to listen to us instead of their usual techno music we had to show them what kind of awesome feedback we could make. Then they retaliated for a whlie, and then someone from Shadytel subjected us to some weird signals, or maybe the equipment was protesting, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>Thanks to ToorCamp for the art grant to help us get equipment and people out there, and Shadytel for being our upstream provider.</p>
