                    <h2>Highlights Since Recorded Times<br/></h2><p><b>2018-11-25</b><br/>Caller asked if this was the escort service of Pasadena, CA. “No, sorry”. Caller hung up before I could provide them with any more information.</p><p><b>2018-12-21</b><br/>Caller asked what else they could do on a Futel. I provided them with some information. “Chill.”</p><p><b>2019-4-23</b><br/>Caller asked if I was the Druid of Sisyphus. “No. No, wait, yes. Are you looking for a specific Druid?” “Yes”, they said. I answered their questions.</p><p><b>2019 spring</b><br/>Caller apologized when I let them know they can call anyone else for free. I didn’t mean it that way.</p><p><b>2019 summer</b><br/>Callers were a couple walking in their new neighborhood. They were excited about Futel, and I explained some of Futel’s telephony services. I told them I was a Druid-in-training. “So you work for the telephone company?” “No.”</p><p><b>2019 fall</b><br/>Caller explained they found a payphone, so they tried calling their cellphone. I told them that they hadn’t miscalled, and told them how to call their cellphone from the payphone. They thanked me, and told me that I sound like a really kind person, and that they hoped it wasn’t too late where ever I was. I thanked them and told them to have a good night. Caller hung up, then I realized I neglected to tell them that dialing a Druid was a good way to test the interactive-ness of a phone booth at midnight.</p><p><b>2020 January</b><br/>Caller asked what plants I grow. I provided them with information. Caller repeated information, then hung up.</p><h2>Druid of Sisyphus Gardens Documented Voicemail</h2><p><b>unknown date</b><br/>Um, hiii. Is this the burrito place?
