                    <p>Futel gets a mention in a <a href="http://www.portlandmercury.com/feature/2016/08/24/18515957/out-of-pocket-portlands-last-pay-phones">Portland Mercury article</a>.</p><p>The author shares our disgust with decommissioned payphones left on site, which are a dangerous public hazard. A caller once told us he used a Futel phone to report a medical emergency on Powell. If he had gone a block the other direction, he would have encountered two nonworking payphones within sight of each other.<br/></p>
