                                    <h1>2018 Operator Log Excerpts</h1>
                    <p>Seven operators logged over 83 calls in 2018, and as usual, they ranged from boring to exciting and amusing to annoying. Here is a sample of logged calls, with some sensitive and many less interesting examples removed.</p>

<h1>2018-01-08 15:36</h1>

<p>Caller wanted to make a call. I told them to hang up and dial 1.</p>

<h1>2018-01-22 9:41</h1>

<p>Caller asked for the number of a specific Social Service attorney, which I provided.</p>

<h1>2018-01-25 12:22</h1>

<p>Caller asked to make a call, I told them to hang up and dial 1.</p>

<h1>2018-02-23 9:25</h1>

<p>&ldquo;I want to call, um, my father&rsquo;s house.&rdquo; &ldquo;Do you know the number?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s &hellip;&hellip;.&rdquo; &ldquo;OK, hang up, dial 1, and call it.&rdquo;</p>

<h1>2018-03-04 17:09</h1>

<p>Caller refused to speak, pressed various buttons.  I heard some voice mail recordings.  Then I thought caller hung up, but no. I mentioned that they could make a call by hanging up and dialing 1. The line went dead.</p>

<h1>2018-03-07 17:09</h1>

<p>Caller identified themselves as an operator with a voicemail password but no account number, seeking a way to retrieve the associated account number.  We decided that the unknown account should be abandoned. Caller was frustrated at the speed with which Futel computers read the password and account number. The call turned away from telephony and towards our complex relationship with permanence.</p>

<h1>2018-03-08 16:30</h1>

<p>Caller wanted to know &ldquo;the meaning&rdquo; of the Futel phone, and of the Fred Flintstones couch (sic) and loudspeaker next to it. I was able to describe the phone &amp; summarize some Futel services. Deeper meaning was elusive. I encouraged caller to explore the menu system &amp; call back with easier questions.  Caller was very grateful, said Futel made caller&rsquo;s day.</p>

<h1>2018-03-11 17:06</h1>

<p>Caller had many questions re: this phone &amp; Futel in general: who runs it, who am I, who are the other operators, are any of them women, how long has this phone been here, et cetera.  I directed caller to the website &amp; shared what trivia I knew.  Caller lives nearby, expressed interest both in hosting a phone and in becoming a Futel operator.  Caller is very happy to discover Futel.  We agreed it is a lovely day today.</p>

<h1>2018-03-13 15:44</h1>

<p>I answered &amp; heard only touch tones. At first I thought caller did not hear me.  But I eventually realized caller answered each of my spoken questions with about as much touch tone pressing as I had used speech, and then waited for me to speak again.  I got the impression caller did not actually need assistance.  I encouraged them to call back when they did.</p>

<h1>2018-03-13 21:35</h1>

<p>Caller told me that they finally found the phone and asked for a suggestion on what to try. I told them to call Sissyphus Gardens.</p>

<h1>2018-03-26 16:20</h1>

<p>Caller (a young person who gave the name of Taylor) wanted to know my name, what kind of phone this was, why it was there.  Taylor thought phone was &ldquo;cool&rdquo;, but described the main menu voice as &ldquo;creepy&rdquo;. I encouraged Taylor to play around with the menu system, but I refused to give my name.  Perhaps that was also creepy, but overall I felt we established a rapport and parted on good terms.</p>

<h1>2018-04-06 17:18</h1>

<p>Caller asked if I remembered Taylor. When I said no, caller said, “ok. bye.” and hung up.</p>

<h1>2018-04-07 13:56</h1>

<p>Caller said they wanted to make a call but decided to call the operator instead. We talked about Futel in general and she asked me how one would be &ldquo;hired&rdquo; by futel. I informed them that we do not hire people but we would love volunteers. Sent them to futel.net for more info.</p>

<h1>2018-05-08 20:44</h1>

<p>Caller said hello, then I heard industrial music and maybe birds chirping? No response when I asked if they needed an operator, so I listened until they hung up.</p>
